# Vulnerability Management Scanner

## Introduction

In this project, I build a vulnerability management scanner in Azure using OpenVAS.

# Create Vulnerability Management Scanner
https://portal.azure.com → Go to the Marketplace → “OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED”

“Start with a pre-set configuration” → Pick the weakest one
“Continue to Create VM”
- Resource Group: Vulnerability-Management
- VM Name: OpenVAS (Take note of the region and Vnet–I used East US 2)
- Authentication: Username → azureuser / Cyberlab123!
- Monitoring: Disable Boot Diagnostic (don’t need it)
- "Review + Create" → Create
  
After the VM has been created, SSH into it with PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) using the credentials you created earlier: ssh azureuser@(Public IP address)
Don’t touch anything, you’ll notice the “Your openvas is deploying, please wait”
Wait until it says “hossted stage done”
