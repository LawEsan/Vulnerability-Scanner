# Vulnerability Management Scanner

## Introduction

In this project, I build a vulnerability management scanner in Azure using OpenVAS.

## Create Vulnerability Management Scanner
https://portal.azure.com → Go to the Marketplace → “OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED”

“Start with a pre-set configuration” → Pick the weakest one
“Continue to Create VM”
- Resource Group Name: Vulnerability-Management
- VM Name: OpenVAS (Take note of the region and Vnet–I used East US 2)
- Authentication: Username / Password → azureuser / Cyberlab123!
- Monitoring: Disable Boot Diagnostic (don’t need it)
- "Review + Create" → Create
  
After the VM has been created, SSH into it with PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS) using the credentials you created earlier: ssh azureuser@(Public IP address)
- Don’t touch anything, you’ll notice the “Your openvas is deploying, please wait”

- Wait until it says “hossted stage done”
- It should show the web app URL and default username and password at this point, attempt to go to the URL in the browser and login with the username and password. If it doesn’t work, try admin/admin:

- After you get logged in, reset the admin password from the original, to: Cyberlab123!
